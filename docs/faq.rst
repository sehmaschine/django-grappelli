FAQ
===

Some questions, some answers.

Why should I use |grappelli|?
-----------------------------

If you are pleased with how the original admin interface looks, you probably shouldn't. Grappelli is mainly about a consistent, grid-based style.

I need help!
------------

see :ref:`Troubleshooting <troubleshooting>`.

Which Browser do I need with Grappelli?
---------------------------------------

We are testing with Firefox, Chrome and Safari. Brave, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi and other modern browsers should work fine as well.

Can I use another editor than TinyMCE?
--------------------------------------

Of course (better use markdown anyway).

How can I contribute?
---------------------
