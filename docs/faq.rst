FAQ
===

Some questions, some answers.

Why should I use |grappelli|?
-----------------------------

If you are pleased with how the original admin interface looks, you shouldn't.

I need help!
------------

see :ref:`Troubleshooting <troubleshooting>`.

Which Browser do I need with Grappelli?
---------------------------------------

We are testing with Firefox, Chrome and Safari. IE9 and Opera should work fine as well.

Can I use another editor than TinyMCE?
--------------------------------------

Of course (better use markdown anyway).

Why don't you use Twitter Bootstrap?
------------------------------------

For now, custom Compass-based stylesheets gives us much more options. But we do understand the need to easily customize the admin interface and we're discussing this issue on a regular basis.

Do you guys cooperate with the Django–Devs?
-------------------------------------------

Occasionally, we discuss features and implementations.

How can I contribute?
---------------------
