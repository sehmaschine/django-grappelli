We are happy if you add tickets and help us to improve Grappelli.
In order to actually review/process tickets we need you to follow these guidelines.

1. Add versions
---------------

When you add a ticket, please tell us which **versions of Grappelli and Django** you're using.
Otherwise we won't be able to review the ticket.

2. Check staticfiles
--------------------

Are all staticfiles correctly loaded? If not, what is missing?

3. Describe javascript errors
-----------------------------

Please check for possible javascript errors and add some details.

4. Customizations
-----------------

If you customized anything (e.g. templates, javascripts), please either explain what you did or test with the latest version of Grappelli.

5. Example
----------

Here's an example of a ticket we can easily review::

    VERSIONS: Grappelli x.x.x, Django x.x
    STATICFILES: OK/ERROR, Details ...
    JAVASCRIPTS: OK/ERROR, Details ...
    CUSTOMIZATIONS: NONE, ...

    Text of your ticket, as detailed as possible (code examples might help)
